## FreJun Task By Pratik Das

The end point of the APIs are as given below:

/initiate-call                  To add(POST) data into server
/call-report/91xxxxxx82         To Get information regarding a number

Api functions are defined in FreJun_Task\PhoneApp\views.py

getAPI is used for call-report and postAPI is used for initiate-call

In this project I have used MongoDB as a database you can view my connections details in settings.py file. Moreover I am adding a screen record of the working of APIs. 

Here I have used POSTMAN to test the APIs

Hope you like it. Looking forward to hear from you

Thanks
